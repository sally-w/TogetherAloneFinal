# TogetherAlone
A MEAN-stack solution final project for Back-end Development Fall 2017.
> This project is TogetherAlone, a "dating app" for introversion in a public setting.  With this application, the user will be able to "match" with locations that fit their intorversion needs.  Using Google popular times, the TogetherAlone user will be able to see live updates regarding the location to determine how "introvert friendly" the location actually is. 

> Each location profile will show the popular times, to determine the introversion level, reviews from users who have previously visited the location, as well as a list of amenities that the location offers, such as free wi-fi, food, music, etc.  When the user is matched with a location, after their visit, they will have the option of posting a review.
